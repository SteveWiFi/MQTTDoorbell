# MQTTDoorbell

This is an MQTT Implementation of the ESPHome doorbell found here: https://www.zuidwijk.com/product/esphome-based-doorbell-v2/

Moreover, I've used the umqttsimple library for Micropython found here: https://github.com/RuiSantosdotme/ESP-MicroPython/blob/master/code/MQTT/umqttsimple.py Upload that file to your ESP8266/ESP32 and you should be good to go.

Using an MQTT broker, this can then be used to send alerts for when anyone rigns the doorbell.
